# cricket-sports-data-pipeline

I built an automated GCP-based data pipeline that:

- Extracts sports statistics from RapidAPI
- Stores raw data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Processes data using Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam)
- Loads structured data into BigQuery for analysis
- Orchestrates the workflow with Cloud Composer (Airflow)
